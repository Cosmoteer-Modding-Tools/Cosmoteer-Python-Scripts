# Progress

## Working Well
- Core GUI flow loads PNGs, previews destruction in real time, and saves outputs with level suffixes.
- Procedural pipeline (holes, scorches, shrapnel) respects transparency and preset defaults.
- Batch scripts and PyInstaller spec provide clear paths for setup, running, and packaging.

## Outstanding Work
- No tracked feature backlog yet; awaiting future requests to extend presets or pipeline effects.
- Need validation of asset completeness (matching punch/cover pairs) when adding new stencil packs.

## Known Issues / Risks
- Unicode glyphs in UI labels within the repo text may indicate encoding drift; ensure final builds display correctly.
- Random seed reroll currently XORs with random bits—verify expectations for repeatability when rerolling frequently.

## Evolution Notes
- Memory Bank established to persist knowledge across sessions starting from this baseline.
- System designed to accommodate new overlay layers or asset types without major refactors.
