# Product Context

## Problem & Motivation
Cosmoteer modders need convincing battle damage overlays without spending time in external art tools. Manual workflows are tedious and difficult to reproduce across variants.

## Target Users
- Cosmoteer modders producing custom ship parts or floor tiles.
- Artists who prefer procedural assistance to generate damaged variants quickly.

## Value Proposition
- One-click presets (33/50/66) encapsulate tuned densities for holes, scorches, and shrapnel.
- Deterministic seeds let creators reroll or reproduce specific looks.
- Asset packs are extensible—drop new stencils or stamps into `assets/` and the tool picks them up automatically.

## User Experience Principles
- Drag-and-drop driven; minimal steps from load to preview to save.
- Real-time preview refresh on slider/checkbox updates.
- Persist last-used folders and settings to reduce repetitive navigation.
